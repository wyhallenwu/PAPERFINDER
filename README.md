### BRIEF INTRO

This is the final project of the course data visualization and human computer interaction at Shanghai University. But  actually, I'm learning followed the course Principles and Techniques of Data Science, UCB fall 2021, the course homepage is https://ds100.org/fa21/ . And also, the course DA100 has its graduate projects. The detailed information is listed in https://ds100.org/fa21/grad_proj/gradproject/. There are also other useful materials I recommand such as https://github.com/microsoft/Data-Science-For-Beginners.  
I try to combine what I learn from these courses to make my own project practical and functional. If it can be exquisite that would great! haha :joy:  
Enjoy it!

Abandon all listed topics above.  
## Project:   
### Develop purpose:  
Trying to make a visualization that can help researchers to quickly find papers they wanted.  
**Existing problems:** One of the difficulties when searching papers is that it is cumbersome to find the most important related papers, especially a classical paper in an area may have serveral thousands citations. Sometimes we have a latest paper and we want to start with this paper to trace back the related papers.
