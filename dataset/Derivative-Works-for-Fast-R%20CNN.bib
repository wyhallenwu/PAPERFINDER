abstract = {Object detection, one of the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, seeks to locate object instances from a large number of predefined categories in natural images. Deep learning techniques have emerged as a powerful strategy for learning feature representations directly from data and have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the field of generic object detection. Given this period of rapid evolution, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent achievements in this field brought about by deep learning techniques. More than 300 research contributions are included in this survey, covering many aspects of generic object detection: detection frameworks, object feature representation, object proposal generation, context modeling, training strategies, and evaluation metrics. We finish the survey by identifying promising directions for future research.},

abstract = {Due to object detection’s close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.},

abstract = {Object detection-the computer vision task dealing with detecting instances of objects of a certain class (e.g., 'car', 'plane', etc.) in images-attracted a lot of attention from the community during the last 5 years. This strong interest can be explained not only by the importance this task has for many applications but also by the phenomenal advances in this area since the arrival of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). This article reviews the recent literature on object detection with deep CNN, in a comprehensive way, and provides an in-depth view of these recent advances. The survey covers not only the typical architectures (SSD, YOLO, Faster-RCNN) but also discusses the challenges currently met by the community and goes on to show how the problem of object detection can be extended. This survey also reviews the public datasets and associated state-of-the-art algorithms.},

Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},

abstract = {Object detection or localization is an incremental step in progression from coarse to fine digital image inference. It not only provides the classes of the image objects, but also provides the location of the image objects which have been classified. The location is given in the form of bounding boxes or centroids. Semantic segmentation gives fine inference by predicting labels for every pixel in the input image. Each pixel is labelled according to the object class within which it is enclosed. Furthering this evolution, instance segmentation gives different labels for separate instances of objects belonging to the same class. Hence, instance segmentation may be defined as the technique of simultaneously solving the problem of object detection as well as that of semantic segmentation. In this survey paper on instance segmentation, its background, issues, techniques, evolution, popular datasets, related work up to the state of the art and future scope have been discussed. The paper provides valuable information for those who want to do research in the field of instance segmentation.},

abstract = {Abstract From the autonomous car driving to medical diagnosis, the requirement of the task of image segmentation is everywhere. Segmentation of an image is one of the indispensable tasks in computer vision. This task is comparatively complicated than other vision tasks as it needs low-level spatial information. Basically, image segmentation can be of two types: semantic segmentation and instance segmentation. The combined version of these two basic tasks is known as panoptic segmentation. In the recent era, the success of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) has influenced the field of segmentation greatly and gave us various successful models to date. In this survey, we are going to take a glance at the evolution of both semantic and instance segmentation work based on CNN. We have also specified comparative architectural details of some state-of-the-art models and discuss their training details to present a lucid understanding of hyper-parameter tuning of those models. We have also drawn a comparison among the performance of those models on different datasets. Lastly, we have given a glimpse of some state-of-the-art panoptic segmentation models.},

abstract = {Le developpement recent de l'apprentissage profond a permis une importante amelioration des resultats dans le domaine de l'analyse d'image. Cependant, la conception d'architectures d'apprentissage profond a meme de resoudre efficacement les tâches d'analyse d'image est loin d'etre simple. De plus, le succes des approches d'apprentissage profond depend fortement de la disponibilite de donnees en grande quantite etiquetees manuellement (par des humains), ce qui est a la fois couteux et peu pratique lors du passage a grande echelle. Dans ce contexte, l'objectif de cette these est d'explorer des approches basees sur l'apprentissage profond pour certaines tâches de comprehension de l'image qui permettraient d'augmenter l'efficacite avec laquelle celles-ci sont effectuees ainsi que de rendre le processus d'apprentissage moins dependant a la disponibilite d'une grande quantite de donnees annotees a la main. Nous nous sommes d'abord concentres sur l'amelioration de l'etat de l'art en matiere de detection d'objets. Plus specifiquement, nous avons tente d'ameliorer la capacite des systemes de detection d'objets a reconnaitre des instances d'objets (meme difficiles a distinguer) en proposant une representation basee sur des reseaux de neurone convolutionnels prenant en compte le aspects multi-region et de segmentation semantique, et capable de capturer un ensemble diversifie de facteurs d'apparence discriminants. De plus, nous avons vise a ameliorer la precision de localisation des systemes de detection d'objets en proposant des schemas iteratifs de detection d'objets et un nouveau modele de localisation pour estimer la boite de delimitation d'un objet. En ce qui concerne le probleme de l'etiquetage des images a l'echelle du pixel, nous avons explore une famille d'architectures de reseaux de neurones profonds qui effectuent une prediction structuree des etiquettes de sortie en apprenant a ameliorer (iterativement) une estimation initiale de celles-ci. L'objectif est d'identifier l'architecture optimale pour la mise en œuvre de tels modeles profonds de prevision structuree. Dans ce contexte, nous avons propose de decomposer la tâche d'amelioration de l'etiquetage en trois etapes : 1) detecter les estimations initialement incorrectes des etiquettes, 2) remplacer les etiquettes incorrectes par de nouvelles etiquettes, et finalement 3) affiner les etiquettes renouvelees en predisant les corrections residuelles. Afin de reduire la dependance a l'effort d'annotation humaine, nous avons propose une approche d'apprentissage auto-supervisee qui apprend les representations semantiques d'images a l'aide d'un reseau de neurones convolutionnel en entrainant ce dernier a reconnaitre la rotation 2d qui est appliquee a l'image qu'il recoit en entree. Plus precisement, les caracteristiques de l'image tirees de cette tâche de prediction de rotation donnent de tres bons resultats lorsqu'elles sont transferees sur les autres tâches de detection d'objets et de segmentation semantique, surpassant les approches d'apprentissage anterieures non supervisees et reduisant ainsi l'ecart avec le cas supervise. Enfin, nous avons propose un nouveau systeme de reconnaissance d'objets qui, apres son entrainement, est capable d'apprendre dynamiquement de nouvelles categories a partir de quelques exemples seulement (typiquement, seulement un ou cinq), sans oublier les categories sur lesquelles il a ete forme. Afin de mettre en œuvre le systeme de reconnaissance propose, nous avons introduit deux nouveautes techniques, un generateur de poids de classification base sur l'attention et un modele de reconnaissance base sur un reseau neuronal convolutionnel dont le classificateur est implemente comme une fonction de similarite cosinusienne entre les representations de caracteristiques et les vecteurs de classification},

abstract = {Object detection is a fundamental visual recognition problem in computer vision and has been widely studied in the past decades. Visual object detection aims to find objects of certain target classes with precise localization in a given image and assign each object instance a corresponding class label. Due to the tremendous successes of deep learning based image classification, object detection techniques using deep learning have been actively studied in recent years. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of recent advances in visual object detection with deep learning. By reviewing a large body of recent related work in literature, we systematically analyze the existing object detection frameworks and organize the survey into three major parts: (i) detection components, (ii) learning strategies, and (iii) applications & benchmarks. In the survey, we cover a variety of factors affecting the detection performance in detail, such as detector architectures, feature learning, proposal generation, sampling strategies, etc. Finally, we discuss several future directions to facilitate and spur future research for visual object detection with deep learning.
