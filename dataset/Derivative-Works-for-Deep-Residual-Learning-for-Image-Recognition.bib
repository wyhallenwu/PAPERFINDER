abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},

abstract = {Object detection is a fundamental visual recognition problem in computer vision and has been widely studied in the past decades. Visual object detection aims to find objects of certain target classes with precise localization in a given image and assign each object instance a corresponding class label. Due to the tremendous successes of deep learning based image classification, object detection techniques using deep learning have been actively studied in recent years. In this paper, we give a comprehensive survey of recent advances in visual object detection with deep learning. By reviewing a large body of recent related work in literature, we systematically analyze the existing object detection frameworks and organize the survey into three major parts: (i) detection components, (ii) learning strategies, and (iii) applications & benchmarks. In the survey, we cover a variety of factors affecting the detection performance in detail, such as detector architectures, feature learning, proposal generation, sampling strategies, etc. Finally, we discuss several future directions to facilitate and spur future research for visual object detection with deep learning. Keywords: Object Detection, Deep Learning, Deep Convolutional Neural Networks},

abstract = {Object detection-the computer vision task dealing with detecting instances of objects of a certain class (e.g., 'car', 'plane', etc.) in images-attracted a lot of attention from the community during the last 5 years. This strong interest can be explained not only by the importance this task has for many applications but also by the phenomenal advances in this area since the arrival of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN). This article reviews the recent literature on object detection with deep CNN, in a comprehensive way, and provides an in-depth view of these recent advances. The survey covers not only the typical architectures (SSD, YOLO, Faster-RCNN) but also discusses the challenges currently met by the community and goes on to show how the problem of object detection can be extended. This survey also reviews the public datasets and associated state-of-the-art algorithms.},

abstract = {With the rapid development of deep learning techniques, deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have become more important for object detection. Compared with traditional handcrafted feature-based methods, the deep learning-based object detection methods can learn both low-level and high-level image features. The image features learned through deep learning techniques are more representative than the handcrafted features. Therefore, this review paper focuses on the object detection algorithms based on deep convolutional neural networks, while the traditional object detection algorithms will be simply introduced as well. Through the review and analysis of deep learning-based object detection techniques in recent years, this work includes the following parts: backbone networks, loss functions and training strategies, classical object detection architectures, complex problems, datasets and evaluation metrics, applications and future development directions. We hope this review paper will be helpful for researchers in the field of object detection.},

abstract = {The development of deep neural networks has driven the development of computer vision. Deep neural networks play an important role in object detection. To improve network performance, before using neural networks for object detection, they are commonly pre-trained on the data set and fine-tuned to their object detection tasks. Pre-training is not always helpful in object detection tasks, so studies have been performed on training neural networks from scratch. By consulting many relevant studies,we performed a systematic analysis of training networks from scratch for object detection. Our article is divided into the following three parts: (i) the reasons for which target detection requires training from scratch, (ii) mainstream networks that can be trained from scratch, and (iii) the criteria for training from scratch. Finally, we summarize some research directions relevant to this topic.},

abstract = {The chapter describes modern neural network designs and discusses their advantages and disadvantages. The state-of-the-art neural networks are usually too much computationally difficult which limits their use in mobile and IoT applications. However, they can be modified with special design techniques which would make them suitable for mobile or IoT applications with limited computational power. These techniques for designing more efficient neural networks are described in great detail. Using them opens a way to create extremely efficient neural networks for mobile or even IoT applications. Such neural networks make the applications very intelligent which paves the way for very smart sensors.},

abstract = {Since convolutional neural network (CNN) models emerged, several tasks in computer vision have actively deployed CNN models for feature extraction. However, the conventional CNN models have a high computational cost and require high memory capacity, which is impractical and unaffordable for commercial applications such as real-time on-road object detection on embedded boards or mobile platforms. To tackle this limitation of CNN models, this paper proposes a wide-residual-inception (WR-Inception) network, which constructs the architecture based on a residual inception unit that captures objects of various sizes on the same feature map, as well as shallower and wider layers, compared to state-of-the-art networks like ResNets. To verify the proposed networks, this paper conducted two experiments; one is a classification task on CIFAR-10/100 and the other is an on-road object detection task using a Single-Shot Multi-box Detector (SSD) on the KITTI dataset. WR-Inception achieves comparable accuracy on CIFAR-10/100, with test errors at 4.82% and 23.12%, respectively, which outperforms 164-layer Pre-ResNets. In addition, the detection experiments demonstrate that the WR-Inception-based SSD outperforms ResNet-101 — based SSD on KITTI. Besides, WR-Inception-based SSD achieves 16 frames per seconds, which is 3.85 times faster than ResNet-101-based SSD. We could expect WR-Inception to be used for real application systems.},

Deep learning techniques have emerged as a powerful strategy for learning feature representations directly from data and have led to remarkable breakthroughs in the field of generic object detection. Given this period of rapid evolution, the goal of this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent achievements in this field brought about by deep learning techniques. More than 300 research contributions are included in this survey, covering many aspects of generic object detection: detection frameworks, object feature representation, object proposal generation, context modeling, training strategies, and evaluation metrics.

abstract = {There are a huge number of features which are said to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accuracy. Practical testing of combinations of such features on large datasets, and theoretical justification of the result, is required. Some features operate on certain models exclusively and for certain problems exclusively, or only for small-scale datasets; while some features, such as batch-normalization and residual-connections, are applicable to the majority of models, tasks, and datasets. We assume that such universal features include Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC), Cross-Stage-Partial-connections (CSP), Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-adversarial-training (SAT) and Mish-activation. We use new features: WRC, CSP, CmBN, SAT, Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss, and combine some of them to achieve state-of-the-art results: 43.5% AP (65.7% AP50) for the MS COCO dataset at a realtime speed of ~65 FPS on Tesla V100.

abstract = {Despite being a core topic for more than several decades, object detection is still receiving increasing attentions due to its irreplaceable importance in a wide variety of applications. Abundant object detectors based on deep neural networks have shown significantly revamped accuracies in recent years. However, it’s still the day one for these models to be effectively deployed to real world. In this dissertation, we focus on object detection models which tackle real world problems that are unavailable few years ago. We also aim at making object detectors on the go, which means detectors are not longer required to be run on workstations and cloud services which is latency unfriendly. To achieve these goals, we addressed the problem in two phases: application and deployment. We have done thoughtful research on both areas. Our contribution involves inter-frame information fusing, model knowledge distillation, advanced model flow control for progressive inference, and hardware oriented model design and optimization. More specifically, we proposed a novel cross-frame verification scheme for spatial temporal fused object detection model for sequential images and videos in a proposal and reject favor. To compress model from a learning basis and resolve domain specific training data shortage, we improved the learning algorithm to handle insufficient labeled data by searching for optimal guidance paths from pre-trained models. To further reduce model inference cost, we designed a progressive neural network which run in flexible cost enabled by RNN style decision controller during runtime. We recognize the awkward model deployment problem, especially for object detection models that require excessive customized layers. In response, we propose to use end-to-end neural network which use pure neural network components to substitute traditional post-processing operations. We also applied operator decomposition and graph level and on-device optimization towards real-time object detection on low power edge devices. All these works have achieved state-of-the-art performances and converted to successful applications. xi},
